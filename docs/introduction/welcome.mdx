BeeAI is an open-source platform that enables organizations to deploy their own AI agent infrastructure. By establishing a centralized platform instance within your organization, BeeAI eliminates the technical barriers between developer teams and end users through standardized agent packaging, deployment, discovery, and governance.

Built on the [Agent Communication Protocol (ACP)](https://agentcommunicationprotocol.dev/) and hosted by the Linux Foundation, BeeAI creates a consistent organizational layer for managing AI agents across any framework.

## The Problem BeeAI Solves

Organizations trying to operationalize AI agents at scale face three critical challenges:
- **Framework Fragmentation:** Development teams build agents using different frameworks (BeeAI, LangChain, CrewAI, custom), creating silos and duplicated efforts
- **Deployment Complexity:** Each agent requires custom deployment processes, making organization-wide scaling difficult
- **Discovery & Governance:** IT lacks centralized control while end users struggle to find and use available agents across the organization

By deploying BeeAI within your organization, you create a standardized infrastructure that supports all agent frameworks:

### For IT & Platform Teams
- Deploy once, manage everywhere - Set up a single BeeAI instance for your entire organization
- Enforce consistent security, compliance, and governance policies across all agents
- Optimize resource allocation and monitor usage across AI workloads
- Establish a single connection point to approved LLM providers

### For Development Teams
- Use any agent framework without worrying about deployment logistics
- Simplified packaging and deployment through standardized containers
- Built-in monitoring and usage metrics
- Self-service publishing to the organizational agent catalog

### For Business Users
- Access a unified catalog of all organization-approved agents
- Consistent interface regardless of underlying agent technology
- Self-service access to AI capabilities
- Seamless agent updates without disruption
