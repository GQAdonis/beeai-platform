## Overview 

BeeAI is an open-source platform that makes it easy to **discover**, **run**, and **share** AI agents. Whether you're an individual developer exploring existing agents or a team looking to standardize your AI agent infrastructure, BeeAI provides a streamlined experience for working with agents from any framework.

Built on the [Agent Communication Protocol (ACP)](https://agentcommunicationprotocol.dev/) and hosted by the Linux Foundation, BeeAI creates a consistent layer that bridges the gap between different agent ecosystems.

## The Problem BeeAI Solves

Teams trying to operationalize AI agents at scale face three critical challenges:
- **Framework Fragmentation:** Agent developers build agents using different frameworks, creating silos and duplicated efforts
- **Deployment Complexity:** Each agent needs its own deployment setup, making it hard to scale
- **Discovery & Management:** Teams lack a central hub where members can find and use available agents

BeeAI provides a standardized platform to discover, run, and share agents from any framework - for both individuals and teams.

## Get Started in Minutes

With a [simple install](/quickstart), you instantly gain access to:
- A **curated catalog of ready-to-use agents** for research, coding, content creation, and more from diverse frameworks
- A **unified CLI & UI** for interacting with any agent through consistent interfaces
- **LLM provider flexibility** to use OpenAI, Anthropic, open-source models via Ollama, or many others

## For Individual Developers

BeeAI makes it easy to experiment with agent capabilities on your own machine:

- **Try agents** instantly from the community catalog without complex setup
- Use **standard interfaces** that create consistent user experiences
- **Package existing agents** from any framework using standardized containers
- **Share agents** with others through a consistent protocol

## For Teams

As you scale from personal experimentation to team adoption, BeeAI grows with you:
- **Deploy a centralized BeeAI instance** that the entire team can access
- Create a **team agent catalog** where developers publish and end users discover agents
- **Standardize agent interfaces** for consistent user experiences
- **Centrally manage LLM connections** to control costs and access
