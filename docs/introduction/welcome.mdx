BeeAI is an open-source platform that enables teams to deploy their own AI agent infrastructure. By establishing a centralized platform instance within your team, BeeAI eliminates the technical barriers between developer teams and end users through standardized agent packaging, deployment, discovery, and management.

Built on the [Agent Communication Protocol (ACP)](https://agentcommunicationprotocol.dev/) and hosted by the Linux Foundation, BeeAI creates a consistent team layer for managing AI agents across any framework.

## The Problem BeeAI Solves

Teams trying to operationalize AI agents at scale face three critical challenges:
- **Framework Fragmentation:** Agent developers build agents using different frameworks (BeeAI, LangChain, CrewAI, custom), creating silos and duplicated efforts
- **Deployment Complexity:** Each agent needs its own deployment setup, making it hard to scale
- **Discovery & Management:** Teams lack a central hub where members can find and use available agents

By deploying BeeAI for your team, you create a standardized infrastructure that supports all agent frameworks:

### For Team Admins
- Set up a centralized deployment that all team members can use
- Apply consistent security and access policies across all agents
- Monitor resource usage and optimize costs
- Configure a single connection to approved LLM providers

### For Agent Developers
- Build with your preferred framework without handling complex deployment
- Package and deploy through standardized containers
- Get built-in monitoring and usage metrics
- Publish directly to your team's agent catalog
- Use standard interfaces that create consistent user experiences

### For End Users
- Find all available agents in one unified catalog
- Experience a consistent interface no matter which agent you use
- Access AI capabilities without technical setup
- Get seamless agent updates without disruption

## Key Features
