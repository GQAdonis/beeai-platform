## Overview

The BeeAI platform utilizes Docker labels to collect essential metadata about agents without the necessity to run the Docker images directly. Each agent exposed in the BeeAI platform is a Docker container.

Users must encapsulate their agents within a Dockerfile. To facilitate this, we provide a [template repository](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-platform-agent-starter) containing both a "Hello World" agent example and a simple Dockerfile to quickly get users started.

## Building Agent Images with BeeAI CLI

To streamline your image building process, BeeAI provides the beeai build command. This command simplifies image creation and automatically ensures metadata labels are properly packed.

### Usage

Run the following command in your terminal either locally or within your Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline:

```bash
beeai build ./path-to-your-agent --tag my-agent:0.0.1 --multi-platform --no-import
```

### Integration with CI Pipelines

The beeai build command integrates smoothly with common CI/CD systems, such as GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins. Hereâ€™s a sample GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
name: Build and Push Agent Image

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Python environment
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.x'

    - name: Install BeeAI CLI
      run: pip install beeai-cli

    - name: Login to Docker Registry
      run: echo "${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}" | docker login your-registry.example.com -u "${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}" --password-stdin

    - name: Build and Push
      run: |
        beeai build ./path-to-your-agent --tag my-agent:0.0.1 --multi-platform --no-import
        docker push your-registry.example.com/my-agent:0.0.1
```


### Running built Agent in the BeeAI Platform

Once the Docker image is built, you can easily install the agent in any BeeAI platform instance by running:

```sh
beeai add your-registry.example.com/my-agent:0.0.1
```

This command allows quick integration of your agent image into the BeeAI platform, making it readily available for use and deployment.
