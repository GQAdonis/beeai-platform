description: "Learn about the open standard for agent communication"
---

BeeAI platform is built on the [Agent Communication Protocol (ACP)](https://agentcommunicationprotocol.dev), an open standard designed to enable smooth communication between AI agents, regardless of what framework they're built on.

<Note>
  For comprehensive documentation on ACP, please visit the [official ACP documentation site](https://agentcommunicationprotocol.dev).

## What is ACP?

ACP standardizes how AI agents communicate, enabling:
- Seamless interoperability between different agent frameworks
- Consistent interfaces for agent inputs and outputs
- Standardized event streams for real-time communication
- Framework-agnostic tooling and infrastructure

## How BeeAI Uses ACP

BeeAI leverages ACP to:
- Discover agents across a wide range of frameworks 
- Run agents locally using your preferred LLM provider
- Orchestrate agents into workflows regardless of how they were built
